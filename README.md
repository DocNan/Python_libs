Python libs contains small python functions for scientific analysis, plotting, et al. It is developed by Nan CHU under the MIT open source lincense. Glad to share these knowledge!

# statistic_lib
Statistic_lib is influenced by this blog [1], which explains what is an errorbar. Functions to calculate other statistic values will be updated in the future.

## standard_error()
Calculate standard error and compare it with standard deviation.

# signal_process_lib
signal_process_lib is for the experimental data analysis with various methods.

## SVD_analysis()
Calculate the major modes structure and frequency.

## equilibrium_lib
gfile in eqdsk format is very commen standard data file from equilibirum codes like EFIT, CHEASE, etc. equilibrium_lib.py is a module to read/write gfile data in python. Here, the test gifle circle15.eqdsk is generated by open source equilibrium code CHEASE [2].
